I have met the main requirments for this asssignment. (1) the basic components for the game options (board size and game mode) and initial game, and (2) S/O placement for human players without checking for the formation of SOS or determining the winner. The following is a sample interface. The implementation of a GUI is strongly encouraged. You should practice object-oriented programming, making your code easy to extend. It is important to separate the user interface code and the game logic code into different classes (refer to the TicTacToe example). xUnit tests are required. I believe that all of these requirments are met and displayed in the documents provided in this github repository.
